Hi!  
I am a final-year Ph.D. student focusing on Machine Learning at the University of Toronto, and [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) advised by Professor [Rich Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php). Before grad school, I obtained my undergraduate degree from Engineering Science at UofT. I was born and raised in Taipei, [Taiwan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYpyquAvYLM).

## Research Interest
My research interests are: 
* Out-of-distribution Detection
* Generative models
* Bayesian inference
* Few-shot learning

***-- "I don't know!!"***  
Humans are pretty good at saying that.   
When I visit Montreal and someone speaks French to me, I panic and somehow indicate that I don't know French.
This seems like basic human instinct.  Yet, most of our AIs today struggle with declaring what they don't know.
I thought this would be quite useful build into AI.  
On my way to figuring that out (i.e. how to declare something being 'out-of-distribution'), I learned about ideas from the topic of generative models, and Bayesian inference.  




## Professional Experience
I was
* a intern at Google Brain (MTV, TOR) in 2018 hosted by [Chung-Cheng Chiu](https://ai.google/research/people/ChungChengChiu). We worked on speech recognition together.
* a research student working with the Toronto Raptors' analysts Keith Boyarsky and Eric Khoury.
