# Bio
Hi! I am a PostDoc at [Stanford CS](https://cs.stanford.edu/) and the [Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance](https://humanperformancealliance.org/). I work closely with Prof. [Serena Yeung](https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/), Prof. [Karen Liu](https://tml.stanford.edu/), Prof. [Scott Delp](https://nmbl.stanford.edu/) and members in their groups. 


Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Machine Learning at the University of Toronto, and [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) advised by Prof. [Rich Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php). I obtained my undergraduate degree from Engineering Science at UofT. I was born and raised in Taipei, [Taiwan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYpyquAvYLM).

# Professional Experience
I was
* an intern at Google Brain (MTV, TOR) in 2018 hosted by [Chung-Cheng Chiu](https://ai.google/research/people/ChungChengChiu). We worked on speech recognition together.
* a research student working with the Toronto Raptors' analysts Keith Boyarsky and Eric Khoury. My mom likes to believe that the Toronto Raptors getting better, and eventually winning the Championship in 2019 had something to do with my research. ü§î
* a ML consultant at SmartFinance LLC, a start-up Rich co-founded. We had some fun trying to make finance easier with ML.
