# Bio

Hi! I am a Research Scientist at [Snap Research](https://research.snap.com/team/all.html) in Palo Alto, where I lead a team focused on personalization in generative models. We are broadly interested in tailoring generative models for individualized, interactive experiences. We're hiring for both full-time roles and 2026 internships ‚Äî feel free to reach out!

Prior to Snap, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford Computer Science and the Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance, where I worked closely with Professors Serena Yeung, C. Karen Liu, and Scott Delp on 4D human reconstruction and generation.
I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Toronto, advised by Professor Rich Zemel, with a focus on generative models and few-shot learning.


<!-- Hi! I am a PostDoc at [Stanford CS](https://cs.stanford.edu/) and the [Wu Tsai Human Performance Alliance](https://humanperformancealliance.org/). I work closely with Prof. [Serena Yeung](https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/), Prof. [Karen Liu](https://tml.stanford.edu/), Prof. [Scott Delp](https://nmbl.stanford.edu/) and members in their groups.


Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. from the University of Toronto (UofT) and [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and was advised by Prof. [Rich Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php). I obtained my undergraduate degree from Engineering Science at UofT. I was born and raised in Taipei, [Taiwan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYpyquAvYLM).

Here is my [CV/Resume](assets/pdf/Kuan_Chieh_Wang_resume-202308.pdf). -->

<!-- # Research Interest
My research centers around deep learning, probabilistic generative models, computer vision, and digital human models.
Clear gaps exist between current AI models and human capabilities, including a 3D understanding of the world and the ability to quickly adapt to new tasks.  Driven by these gaps, my recent focus is on <span class="font-weight-bold">*3D computer vision*</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">*open-world learning*</span>.

OLD
Along with my colleagues , we think about how to use AI and neural networks to optimize athletic performance üèãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  More specifically, my current projects revolve around <span class="font-weight-bold">3D human motion reconstruction from casually captured videos</span>.

# Professional Experience
I was
* an intern at Google Brain (MTV, TOR) in 2018 hosted by [Chung-Cheng Chiu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ixhmT3AAAAAJ&hl=en). We worked on speech recognition together.
* a research student working with the Toronto Raptors' analysts Keith Boyarsky and Eric Khoury üèÄ. My mom likes to believe that the Toronto Raptors getting better, and eventually winning the Championship in 2019 had something to do with my research. ü§î
* a ML consultant at SmartFinance LLC, a start-up Rich co-founded. We had some fun trying to make finance easier with ML. -->
